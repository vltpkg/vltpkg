      Before completing your work, run the following validation steps in sequence:

      1. Format code:
         ```bash
         pnpm format
         ```
         This ensures consistent code formatting across the codebase.
         If formatting issues are found, fix them before proceeding.

      2. Lint code:
         ```bash
         pnpm lint
         ```
         This checks for style guide violations and potential issues.
         If linting errors are found:
         - **For common linting issues (unused variables/imports)**: Refer to `@linting-error-handler.mdc` for systematic solutions
         - Review each error message
         - Fix the issues in the affected files
         - Run `pnpm lint` again to verify fixes
         
         💡 **Pro tip**: Most linting errors fall into common patterns. Use the linting error handler rule for quick, systematic fixes.

      3. Run tests:
         ```bash
         pnpm test -Rtap --disable-coverage
         ```
         This runs all tests without coverage reporting.
         If tests fail:
         - Review the test output for failures
         - Fix any failing tests
         - Run tests again to verify fixes

         3.1. Running tests for a specific file:
             ```bash
             pnpm test -Rtap --disable-coverage <path-to-test-file.ts>
             ```
             Use this command when working on a specific module to iterate faster.
             Example:
             ```bash
             pnpm test -Rtap --disable-coverage test/index.ts
             ```

         3.2. Updating snapshots:
             ```bash
             pnpm snap -Rtap --disable-coverage <path-to-test-file.ts>
             ```
             ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Snapshots are asserting expected results, they should only be updated if all breaking changes to tests are intentional.
             Before updating snapshots:
             - Review all snapshot changes carefully
             - Ensure the changes are expected and intentional
             - Document any breaking changes in your work
             - Consider discussing major snapshot updates with the team

      4. Check test coverage:
         ```bash
         pnpm test -Rsilent --coverage-report=text-lcov
         ```
         This generates a coverage report in lcov format.
         If coverage is insufficient:
         - Review the coverage report
         - Add tests for uncovered code paths
         - Run coverage check again to verify improvements

         4.1. Checking coverage for a specific file:
             ```bash
             pnpm test -Rsilent --coverage-report=text-lcov <path-to-test-file.ts>
             ```
             Use this to focus coverage analysis on a specific module.
             Example:
             ```bash
             pnpm test -Rsilent --coverage-report=text-lcov test/index.ts
             ```

      5. Run type checking:
         ```bash
         pnpm posttest
         ```
         This runs the TypeScript type checker for the current workspace.
         Make sure you're in the appropriate folder for the workspace you're working on.
         For example, to check types on the `@vltpkg/semver` workspace, navigate to the `src/semver` folder first.
         
         If type checking errors are found:
         - Review each type error message carefully
         - Fix type issues in the affected files
         - Run `pnpm posttest` again to verify fixes
         - Ensure all type definitions are correct and complete

      ## Test Quality Guidelines

      When writing tests, follow these guidelines to ensure high-quality, maintainable tests:

      ### Respect Type Contracts
      **CRITICAL**: Always respect the existing type structure when creating test scenarios:
      
      - **Never use `as any` to bypass type checking in tests** unless absolutely necessary for testing error conditions
      - **Study the actual type definitions** before creating mock objects or test data
      - **Use proper type-safe test fixtures** that match the real type contracts
      - **Avoid creating impossible scenarios** that violate the type system
      
      **Example of what NOT to do:**
      ```typescript
      // ❌ BAD: Violates type contract - Edge.spec is required and non-nullable
      const edge = {
        spec: undefined as any, // This breaks the type contract
        // ... other properties
      }
      ```
      
      **Example of what TO do:**
      ```typescript
      // ✅ GOOD: Respects type contract - creates proper Spec object
      const spec = Spec.parse('package-name', '^1.0.0', specOptions)
      const edge = {
        spec, // Proper Spec object that matches the type contract
        // ... other properties
      }
      ```

      ### Test Realistic Scenarios
      - **Test edge cases that can actually happen** in the real codebase
      - **Use existing test fixtures** when possible rather than creating new ones
      - **Consult similar tests** in the same module for patterns and approaches
      - **Reference actual implementation code** to understand what scenarios are possible

      ### Type-Safe Test Creation Process
      1. **Read the type definitions** of the classes/interfaces you're testing
      2. **Examine existing test files** in the same directory for patterns
      3. **Use helper functions** from test fixtures when available
      4. **Validate your test compiles** without type assertions (`as any`)
      5. **Run type checking** to ensure your tests don't introduce type violations

      Important notes:
      - Always run these commands in sequence
      - Do not proceed to the next step if the current step fails
      - Complete your work only after all validation steps pass
      - If you're unsure about any errors, ask for help

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Skipping validation steps or running tests with coverage
      # Missing format, lint, and test steps
      pnpm test -Rtap  # Running tests with coverage in one step
      pnpm snap -Rtap  # Updating snapshots without reviewing changes

      # Good: Complete validation workflow
      pnpm format
      pnpm lint
      pnpm test -Rtap --disable-coverage
      pnpm test -Rsilent --coverage-report=text-lcov
      pnpm posttest
      
      # Bad: Creating tests that violate type contracts
      const edge = {
        spec: undefined as any, // Violates Edge type contract
        // ...
      }
      
      # Good: Creating type-safe tests
      const spec = Spec.parse('package-name', '^1.0.0', specOptions)
      const edge = {
        spec, // Respects Edge type contract
        // ...
      }

      # Good: Iterative development workflow
      pnpm test -Rtap --disable-coverage test/index.ts
      # Make changes to the code
      pnpm format
      pnpm lint
      pnpm test -Rtap --disable-coverage test/index.ts
      # Review snapshot changes carefully
      pnpm snap -Rtap --disable-coverage test/index.ts
      # Check coverage for the specific file
      pnpm test -Rsilent --coverage-report=text-lcov test/index.ts
      # Type check
      pnpm posttest
