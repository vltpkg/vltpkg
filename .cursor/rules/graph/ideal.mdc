      ## Overview

      The Ideal Graph represents the desired post-install state. It is constructed by:
      1. Selecting a starting graph: prefer Virtual (lockfile) and fall back to Actual (`node_modules`) when needed.
      2. Merging user-provided `add`/`remove` requests with importer manifest deltas.
      3. Expanding dependencies by fetching manifests/artifacts and recursively placing packages.
      4. Reusing existing nodes that satisfy specs to minimize network and duplication.
      5. Optionally extracting tarballs during graph construction for improved performance (early extraction).

      Entry point: `src/graph/src/ideal/build.ts` → `ideal.build(options)`

    message: |
      ## Starting Graph Selection (`build.ts`)

      - Attempts to load a Virtual Graph from lockfile first with `skipLoadingNodesOnModifiersChange: true`.
      - On failure, loads the Actual Graph with the same skip flag.
      - Uses shared instances of `packageJson`, `scurry`, and `monorepo` for efficiency.
      - Delegates to `buildIdealFromStartingGraph()` for merging and expansion.

      ## Merge and Expansion (`build-ideal-from-starting-graph.ts`)

      - Computes importer deltas via `get-importer-specs.ts`:
        - Builds `AddImportersDependenciesMap` and `RemoveImportersDependenciesMap` by comparing importer manifests to the starting graph.
        - Prunes already-satisfied dependencies using `remove-satisfied-specs.ts`.
        - Flags whether dependencies were modified (`modifiedDependencies`).
      - Merges user-provided `add`/`remove` over computed deltas; user input wins.
      - Invokes `add-nodes.ts` to fetch and incorporate remote manifests and expand the graph.
      - After expansion, calls `setDefaultLocation()` on nodes to normalize store layout hints.
      - Finally, removes dependencies listed in `remove` via `remove-nodes.ts` and garbage-collects unreachable nodes (`graph.gc()`).

      ## Node Appending and Reuse (`append-nodes.ts`, `add-nodes.ts`)

      - Resolves dependency specs to nodes by first attempting `graph.findResolution()` to reuse existing nodes that satisfy the spec.
      - When a satisfying node is not found, fetches manifests/artifacts via `@vltpkg/package-info`, selects appropriate versions (respecting platform/engine constraints), and places new nodes with correct flags.
      - Recursively descends into each newly placed node's dependencies, applying `@vltpkg/spec` parsing and honoring modifiers if present.
      - Ensures added nodes have consistent `registry`, `resolved`, and `integrity` fields as available.

  - type: architecture_guide
    message: |
      ## Early Extraction Feature (`append-nodes.ts`)

      - When an `actual` graph is provided to the build process, the Ideal builder can perform early extraction of tarballs.
      - As nodes are placed into the graph, if they don't exist in the actual graph and are destined for the vlt store, extraction begins immediately.
      - Extraction happens in parallel with graph construction, improving overall install performance.
      - The `node.extracted` property tracks whether a node has been extracted to avoid duplicate extractions.
      - This optimization is particularly beneficial when no cached information is available.

      ## Options and Inputs

      - `projectRoot`, `packageJson`, `scurry`, `monorepo` — Required/shared instances for deterministic traversal and manifest access.
      - `packageInfo: PackageInfoClient` — Required for remote manifest and artifact retrieval.
      - `add?: AddImportersDependenciesMap` — Explicit dependencies to add per importer.
      - `remove?: RemoveImportersDependenciesMap` — Explicit dependency names to remove per importer.
      - `actual?: Graph` — Optional actual graph to enable early extraction optimization during ideal graph construction.
      - Modifiers integration — If `modifiers` are provided, selectors can adjust specs during resolution; Ideal builder will then record modifier info on nodes for downstream awareness.

      ### Behavior and Guarantees
      - Reuses nodes whenever they satisfy requested specs.
      - Expands transitive dependencies recursively using resolved manifests.
      - Produces a graph ready for hoisting and reification, with stable, default locations set where applicable.

      ## Practical Tips

      - Always prefer the lockfile as the starting point for reproducibility.
      - Keep `add`/`remove` mappings minimal; rely on `get-importer-specs.ts` to detect manifest drift.
      - Pass shared `packageJson` and `scurry` instances across phases (Actual/Virtual load → Ideal build → Reify).
      - Use `graph.findResolution()` aggressively in new features to avoid duplicate nodes and redundant network calls.

examples:
  - input: |
      import { ideal } from '@vltpkg/graph'
      const graph = await ideal.build({ projectRoot, packageInfo, packageJson, scurry })
    output: "Ideal graph built from lockfile or actual as starting point"

  - input: |
      // Add and remove across importers
      const add = new Map()
      const remove = new Map()
      const g = await ideal.build({ projectRoot, packageInfo, packageJson, scurry, add, remove })
    output: "Importer deltas merged with user-provided add/remove and expanded"

  - input: |
      // Build ideal with early extraction optimization
      import { ideal, actual } from '@vltpkg/graph'
      const actualGraph = actual.load({ projectRoot, packageJson, scurry })
      const idealGraph = await ideal.build({ 
        projectRoot, 
        packageInfo, 
        packageJson, 
        scurry,
        actual: actualGraph 
      })
    output: "Ideal graph built with early tarball extraction for improved performance"
