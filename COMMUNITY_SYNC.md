# Community Syncs

## What?

In our ongoing efforts to better listen to and collaborate with the
community, we've started a **Weekly Community Sync** that helps to
keep development and conversations forward. It is notably a call
without a strict agenda although we do our best to premptively mark
issues and PRs to discuss prior to the calls.

### When?

**Thursdays at 2:00 PM EST**

Previous meetings, agendas & notes can be found
[here](https://github.com/vltpkg/vltpkg/tree/main/meetings) or watched
on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@vltpkg).

You can track all **vlt** public events by adding/tracking our
