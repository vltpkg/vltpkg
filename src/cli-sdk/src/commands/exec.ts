    description: `Run a command defined by a package, installing it
                  if necessary.

                  If the package specifier is provided explicitly via the
                  \`--package\` config, then that is what will be used. If
                  a satisfying instance of the named package exists in the
                  local \`node_mnodules\` folder, then that will be used.

                  If \`--package\` is not set, then vlt will attempt to infer
                  the package to be installed if necessary, in the following
                  manner:

                  - If the first argument is an executable found in the
                    \`node_modules/.bin\` folder (ie, provided by an
                    installed direct dependency), then that will be used.
                    The search stops, and nothing will be installed.
                  - Otherwise, vlt attempts to resolve the first argument
                    as if it was a \`--package\` option, and then swap it
                    out with the "default" executable provided by that
                    package.

                  The "default" executable provided by a package is:

                  - If the package provides a single executable string in the
                    \`bin\` field, then that is the executable to use.
                  - Otherwise, if there is a \`bin\` with the same name
                    as the package (or just the portion after the \`/\` in
                    the case of scoped packages), then that will be used.

                  If the appropriate excutable cannot be determined, then
                  an error will be raised.

                  At no point will \`vlt exec\` change the locally installed
                  dependencies. Any installs it performs is done in vlt's XDG
                  data directory.
