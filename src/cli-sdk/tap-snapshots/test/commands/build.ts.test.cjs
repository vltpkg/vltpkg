Usage:
  vlt build [query]
  vlt build [--target=<query>]

Build the project based on the current dependency graph.

This command processes the installed packages in node_modules and runs any
necessary build steps, such as lifecycle scripts and binary linking.
The build process is idempotent and will only perform work that is actually
needed based on the current state of the dependency graph.
Use --target option or provide a query as a positional argument to filter
packages using DSS query language syntax, otherwise it will target all packages
with scripts (:scripts) by default.

  Options

    target
      Query selector to filter packages using DSS syntax.

      â€‹--target=<query>
