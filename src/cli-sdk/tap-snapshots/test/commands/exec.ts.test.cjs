Usage:
  vlt exec [command]

Run an arbitrary command, with the local installed packages first in the PATH.
Ie, this will run your locally installed package bins.

If no command is provided, then a shell is spawned in the current working
directory, with the locally installed package bins first in the PATH.

Note that any vlt configs must be specified *before* the command, as the
remainder of the command line options are provided to the exec process.
