Usage:
  vlt exec [--package=<pkg>] [command...]

Run a command defined by a package, installing it if necessary.

If the package specifier is provided explicitly via the \`--package\` config, then
that is what will be used. If a satisfying instance of the named package exists
in the local \`node_mnodules\` folder, then that will be used.

If \`--package\` is not set, then vlt will attempt to infer the package to be
installed if necessary, in the following manner:

- If the first argument is an executable found in the \`node_modules/.bin\` folder
(ie, provided by an installed direct dependency), then that will be used. The
search stops, and nothing will be installed.
- Otherwise, vlt attempts to resolve the first argument as if it was a
\`--package\` option, and then swap it out with the "default" executable provided
by that package.

The "default" executable provided by a package is:

- If the package provides a single executable string in the \`bin\` field, then
that is the executable to use.
- Otherwise, if there is a \`bin\` with the same name as the package (or just the
portion after the \`/\` in the case of scoped packages), then that will be used.

If the appropriate excutable cannot be determined, then an error will be raised.

At no point will \`vlt exec\` change the locally installed dependencies. Any
installs it performs is done in vlt's XDG data directory.
