  "    --expect-lockfile                    Fail if lockfile is missing or out of date. Used by ci command to enforce lockfile integrity.",
  "    --expect-results=<value>             When running \`vlt query\`, this option allows you to set a expected number of resulting items. Accepted values are numbers and strings. Strings starting with \`>\`, \`<\`, \`>=\` or \`<=\` followed by a number can be used to check if the result is greater than or less than a specific number.",
  "    --fallback-command=<command>         The command to run when the first argument doesn't match any known commands. For pnpm-style behavior, set this to 'run-exec'. e.g: \`\`\` â€‹vlt config set fallback-command=run-exec \`\`\`",

  "-A, --git-host-archives=<name=template>  Similar to the \`--git-host <name>=<template>\` option, this option can define a template string that will be expanded to provide the URL to download a pre-built tarball of the git repository. In addition to the n-th path portion expansions performed by \`--git-host\`, this field will also expand the string \`$committish\` in the template, replacing it with the resolved git committish value to be fetched.",
  "-G, --git-hosts=<name=template>          Map a shorthand name to a git remote URL template. The \`template\` may contain placeholders, which will be swapped with the relevant values. \`$1\`, \`$2\`, etc. are replaced with the appropriate n-th path portion. For example, \`github:user/project\` would replace the \`$1\` in the template with \`user\`, and \`$2\` with \`project\`.",
  "    --git-shallow                        Set to force \`--depth=1\` on all git clone actions. When set explicitly to false with --no-git-shallow, then \`--depth=1\` will not be used. When not set explicitly, \`--depth=1\` will be used for git hosts known to support this behavior.",

  "-i, --identity=<name>                    Provide a string to define an identity for storing auth information when logging into registries. Authentication tokens will be stored in the XDG data directory, in \`vlt/auth/\${identity}/keychain.json\`.

  "    --if-present                         When running scripts across multiple packages, only include packages that have the script. If this is not set, then the run will fail if any packages do not have the script. This will default to true if --scope, --workspace, --workspace-group, or --recursive is set. Otherwise, it will default to false.",
  "    --jsr-registries=<name=url>          Map alias names to JSR.io registry urls. For example, \`--jsr-registries acme=https://jsr.acme.io/\` would tell vlt to fetch any packages with the \`acme:\` registry prefix from the \`https://jsr.acme.io/\` registry, using the \\"npm Compatibility\\" translation. So for example, the package \`acme:@foo/bar\` would fetch the \`@jsr/foo__bar\` package from the \`jsr.acme.io\` registry. By default the \`jsr\` alias is always mapped to \`https://npm.jsr.io/\`, so existing \`jsr:\` packages will be fetched from the public \`jsr\` registry appropriately.",
  "    --lockfile-only                      Only update the lockfile (vlt-lock.json) and package.json files, skip all node_modules operations including package extraction and filesystem changes.",

  "    --package=<p>                        When running \`vlt exec\`, this allows you to explicitly set the package to search for bins. If not provided, then vlt will interpret the first argument as the package, and attempt to run the default executable.",
  "    --port=<number>                      Port for the browser-based UI server when using vlt serve command (default: 8000).",
  "    --publish-directory=<path>           Directory to use for pack and publish operations instead of the current directory. The directory must exist and nothing will be copied to it.",
  "-r, --recursive                          Run an operation across multiple workspaces. No effect when used in non-monorepo projects. Implied by setting --workspace or --workspace-group. If not set, then the action is run on the project root.",
  "    --registries=<name=url>              Specify named registry hosts by their prefix. To set the default registry used for non-namespaced specifiers, use the \`--registry\` option. Prefixes can be used as a package alias. For example: \`\`\` â€‹vlt --registries loc=http://reg.local install foo@loc:foo@1.x \`\`\` By default, the public npm registry is registered to the \`npm:\` prefix. It is not recommended to change this mapping in most cases.",
  "    --registry=<url>                     Sets the registry for fetching packages, when no registry is explicitly set on a specifier. For example, \`express@latest\` will be resolved by looking up the metadata from this registry. Note that alias specifiers starting with \`npm:\` will still map to \`https://registry.npmjs.org/\` if this is changed, unless the a new mapping is created via the \`--registries\` option.",
  "    --registry-port=<number>             Port for the VSR registry when using vlt serve command (default: 1337).",

  "-s, --scope=<query>                      Set to filter the scope of an operation using a DSS Query.",
  "    --scope-registries=<@scope=url>      Map package name scopes to registry URLs. For example, \`--scope-registries @acme=https://registry.acme/\` would tell vlt to fetch any packages named \`@acme/...\` from the \`https://registry.acme/\` registry. Note: this way of specifying registries is more ambiguous, compared with using the \`--registries\` field and explicit prefixes, because instead of failing when the configuration is absent, it will instead attempt to fetch from the default registry. By comparison, using \`--registries acme=https://registry.acme/\` and then specifying dependencies such as \`\\"foo\\": \\"acme:foo@1.x\\"\` means that regardless of the name, the package will be fetched from the explicitly named registry, or fail if no registry is defined with that name. However, custom registry aliases are not supported by other package managers.",
  "    --script-shell=<program>             The shell to use when executing \`package.json#scripts\`. For \`vlt exec\` and \`vlt exec-local\`, this is never set, meaning that command arguments are run exactly as provided. For \`vlt run\` (and other things that run lifecycle scripts in \`package.json#scripts\`), the entire command with all arguments is provided as a single string, meaning that some value must be provided for shell interpretation, and so for these contexts, the \`script-shell\` value will default to \`/bin/sh\` on POSIX systems or \`cmd.exe\` on Windows.",
  "    --stale-while-revalidate-factor=<n>  If the server does not serve a \`stale-while-revalidate\` value in the \`cache-control\` header, then this multiplier is applied to the \`max-age\` or \`s-maxage\` values. By default, this is \`60\`, so for example a response that is cacheable for 5 minutes will allow a stale response while revalidating for up to 5 hours. If the server *does* provide a \`stale-while-revalidate\` value, then that is always used. Set to 0 to prevent any \`stale-while-revalidate\` behavior unless explicitly allowed by the server's \`cache-control\` header.",

  "    --view=<output>                      Configures the output format for commands. Defaults to \`human\` if stdout is a TTY, or \`json\` if it is not. - human: Maximally ergonomic output reporting for human consumption. - json: Parseable JSON output for machines. - inspect: Output results with \`util.inspect\`. - gui: Start a local web server and opens a browser to explore the results. (Only relevant for certain commands.) - mermaid: Output mermaid diagramming syntax. (Only relevant for certain commands.) - silent: Suppress all output to stdout. If the requested view format is not supported for the current command, or if no option is provided, then it will fall back to the default.",
