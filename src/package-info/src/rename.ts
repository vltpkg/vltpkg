/**
 * On posix systems, rename is atomic and will clobber anything in its way
 * However, on Windows, it can fail with the rather unhelpful EPERM error if
 * the target directory is not removed in time or is currently in use.
 *
 * While true atomic semantics is not available on Windows in this case, we can
 * at least implement the posix overwrite semantics by explicitly removing the
 * target when this error occurs.
 *
 * This is only relevant when renaming *directories*, since files will
 * generally not raise problems. When/if we rename directories outside of
 * package-info, this can be moved to its own shared module.
