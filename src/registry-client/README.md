# @vltpkg/registry-client

This is a very light wrapper around undici, optimized for interfacing
with an npm registry.

## Overview

Any response with `immutable` in the `cache-control` header, or with a
`content-type` of `application/octet-stream` or a path ending in
`.tgz`, will be cached forever and never requested again as long as
the cache survives.

If the request has a cached response:

- Cached responses with `immutable` in the `cache-control` header will
  be returned from cache without a network request, no matter what.
- Cached responses with a `content-type` of `application/octet-stream`
  will be returned from cache without a network request, no matter
  what, because tarballs are immutable.
- Cached responses with `max-age=<n>` or `s-max-age=<n>` will be
  served from cache without a network request if it's less than `<n>`
  seconds old.
- Otherwise, a network request to the registry will be made
  - if an `etag` is present in the cached response, it will be used as
    the `if-none-match` header.
  - If a `last-modified` header is in the response, that will be used
    as the `if-modified-since` request header.
  - If there is no `last-modified` header, then use the `mtime` of the
    cache file as the `if-modified-since` header.

This is the extent of the cache control logic. It is not a
full-featured spec-compliant caching HTTP client, because that is not
needed for this use case. Every response will be cached, even if the
registry headers don't technically allow it.

## Cache Unzipped

Client always sends `accept-encoding: gzip;q=1.0, *;q=0.5` header when
making requests, to save time on the wire.

If response has `content-encoding: gzip`, then we swap out the body
for the unzipped response body in the cache, as if it was not gzipped
in the first place. This _must_ be done before returning the response,
because you can't `JSON.parse()` a gzipped response anyway.

If the response is `content-type: application/octet-stream` and starts
with the gzip header, then we return the raw body as we received it,
but as a best-effort background job, unzip it and update the cache
entry to be an unzipped response body. This is done in the
`@vltpkg/cache-unzip` worker.

So,

- json responses will always be un-zipped, in the response and in the
  cache.
- artifact responses _may_ be gzipped (and thus, have to be unzipped
  by the unpack operation), but will eventually be cached as unzipped
  tarballs.

Thus, the `content-length` response header will _usually_ not match
the actual byte length of the response body.

## Integrity Options

An `integrity` option may be specified in a `fetchOptions.context`
object, or in the options provided to `cache.set()`. For example:

```js
const integrity = `sha512-${base64hash}`
// Sets the key, and links to a file based on the integrity
// value. Any future fetches for the same integrity will yield
// this value.
cache.set(key, value, { integrity })

// Load an entry with this integrity value, if present in the
// on-disk cache, and when writing back to the disk, link to the
// appropriate integrity file as well.
const value = await cache.fetch(key, { context: { integrity } })
```

If the integrity provided is obviously not a valid sha512 `Integrity`
string, then it is ignored.

Integrity values are not calculated or verified. The caller must do
this check, if desired.

Note that the integrity provided to `cache.fetch()` or `cache.set()`
does _not_ typically match the calculated integrity of the object
being cached. Typically, the integrity is related to the body of the
response that a `@vltpkg/registry-client.CacheEntry` object
represents.

## Usage

```js
import { Cache } from '@vltpkg/cache'

// set in the memory cache, and return immediately. in the
// background, write the entry to disk.
cache.set(someKey, someBuffer)

// if you need to wait for all pending writes to finish pending,
// you can do that like this
await cache.promise()

// get an item from the memory cache if possible, falling back to
// loading by integrity/key from the disk. Integrity is optional.
const value = await cache.fetch(someKey, { context: { integrity }})

// get from the memory cache *only*, do not read from the disk
const value = cache.get(someKey)

// Synchronous form of cache.fetch()
const value = cache.fetchSync(someKey, { context: { integrity }})

// sync and async iteration is supported
// walks over all items on disk
for await (const item of cache) { ... }
for (const item of cache) { ... }
```
