import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

Usage:

<Code
  code="$ vlt exec-local [command]"
  title="Terminal"
  lang="bash"
/>

Run an arbitrary command, with the local installed packages first in
the PATH. Ie, this will run your locally installed package bins.

If no command is provided, then a shell is spawned in the current
working directory, with the locally installed package bins first in
the PATH.

Note that any vlt configs must be specified _before_ the command, as
the remainder of the command line options are provided to the exec
process.
