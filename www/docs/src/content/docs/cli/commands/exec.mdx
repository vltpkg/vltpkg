import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

Usage:

<Code code="$ vlt exec [command]" title="Terminal" lang="bash" />

Run an arbitrary command, with the local installed packages first in the PATH. Ie, this will run your locally installed package bins.

If no command is provided, then a shell is spawned in the current working directory, with the locally installed package bins first in the PATH.

Note that any vlt configs must be specified *before* the command, as the remainder of the command line options are provided to the exec process.
