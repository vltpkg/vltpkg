import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

Usage:

<Code code="$ vlt ping" title="Terminal" lang="bash" />

Ping all configured registries to verify connectivity and check
registry health. Registries that share the same URL as the default
registry are deduplicated and only pinged once.

## Ping a specific registry

<Code code="$ vlt ping [<registry-alias>]" title="Terminal" lang="bash" />

Ping a single registry by its alias. Registry aliases are configured
via the `registries` field in `vlt.json` or with the `--registries`
option.
