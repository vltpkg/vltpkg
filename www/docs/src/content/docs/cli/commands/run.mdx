import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

Usage:

<Code
  code="$ vlt run <script> [args ...]"
  title="Terminal"
  lang="bash"
/>

Run a script defined in 'package.json', passing along any extra
arguments. Note that vlt config values must be specified _before_ the
script name, because everything after that is handed off to the script
process.

## Aliases

```
r, run-script
