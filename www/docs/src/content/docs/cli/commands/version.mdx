<Code
  code="$ vlt version [<newversion> | major | minor | patch | premajor | preminor | prepatch | prerelease]"
  title="Terminal"
  lang="bash"
/>

Bump a package's version.

Run in a package directory to bump the version and write the new data
back to package.json.

The `<newversion>` argument should be a valid semver string or a valid
increment type (one of patch, minor, major, prepatch, preminor,
premajor, prerelease).

If run in a git repository, it will also create a version commit and
tag.
