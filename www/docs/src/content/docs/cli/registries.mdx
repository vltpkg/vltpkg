The vlt client supports working with multiple registries in a variety
of ways.

## What is a Registry? (skip if you know this already)

A registry is a server that provides the metadata and artifacts for a
package manager to install.

The most popular package registry is
[the public npm registry](https://registry.npmjs.org), which
JavaScript package managers use for the bulk of their content. It is
common for organizations to set up private internal registries for use
with their non-OSS code, or to mirror public registries for
redundancy, security, and auditing capability.

[VSR](https://www.vlt.sh/serverless-registry) is a hosted serverless
registry that vlt provides for this purpose.

Packages that are referenced by a name and version or version range
(or a `dist-tag` like `latest`) are resolved using a registry.
Packages specified as a git remote URL or `https://` remote URL, are
resolved without using a registry. And obviously, packages referenced
as a `file://` URL or `workspace:` specifier do not need to be fetched
from anywhere at all, because they are local on the current machine.

## Setting the Default Registry

By default, vlt fetches packages from
[the public npm registry](https://registry.npmjs.org/) at
`https://registry.npmjs.org/`.

You can change this by
[setting the `registry` configuration option](/cli/configuring#--registryurl).

For example, if you wanted instead to fetch pacakges from yarn's DNS
alias of the public npm registry for some reason, you could do this:

```bash
vlt config set registry=https://registry.yarnpkg.com
```

There can be only one default registry, and this is used as the
fallback for all package registry resolutions. Normally, if an
internal registry is used as the default registry for all fetches, it
effectively must serve _all_ packages, meaning it has to be a caching
proxy, as well as the repository for any of your organization's
internal code.

## Named Scope Registries (npm Compatibility)

Like the npm client, the vlt client allows you to map a given scope to
a specific registry.

For example, you could make it so that all packages whose names start
with `@mycompany/...` are served from your internal registry.

This can be a convenient way to make only _certain_ packages come from
internal private registries, while all the _other_ packages come from
a default public registry, meaning that you do not need to proxy
everything.

To do this in vlt, use the `scope-registries` configuration.

```bash
vlt config set scope-registries=@mycompany=https://registry.local/
```

When you do this in your project, you will see that it adds the option
to a `vlt.json` file in your project root.

```bash
$ cat vlt.json
{
  "scope-registries": {
    "@mycompany": "https://registry.local/",
  }
}
```

If you run this command multiple times, you can set different
registries for various different scopes.

## Registry Aliases

Another way to provide very explicit registry behavior is to use a
registry alias.

Similar to how a named package can be aliased to another name and
version, the vlt client allows you to indicate that you want a given
package to come from a specific named registry.

First, create a registry alias by adding an entry to the `registries`
config:

```bash
$ vlt config set registries=bar=https://registry.example.com/
```

This will add the appropriate entry to the `vlt.json` file:

```bash
$ cat vlt.json
{
  "registries": {
    "bar": "https://registry.example.com/"
  }
}
```

Now, if you have this in your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "bloo": "bar:bloo@1.2"
  }
}
```

then the `bloo` package will always come from my defined `bar:`
registry alias.

You can also of course use this to install packages from a known
registry by alias on the command line:

```bash
$ vlt install bar:bloo@1.2
```

### Special Aliases:

#### `npm:`

For backwards compatibility with npm (and existing packages on the
public npm registry), the `npm:` alias is set by default to the public
npm registry.

If the `registry` config is set to another value, for example a
caching proxy in your organization's network, then the `npm:` alias
will default to that value as well, in order to maintain compatibility
with existing packages that might be getting proxied through the
internal registry.

#### `jsr:`

The `jsr:` alias is a special alias that allow you to install packages
from [JavaScript Registry (jsr)](https://jsr.io).

For example, you can install a package from the JSR registry like
this:

```bash
$ vlt install jsr:@am/neuralNetwork@1.0.0
```

Like the `npm:` alias, the `jsr:` alias can be supressed by setting
the `registry` config option to a different value, such as a caching
proxy in your organization's network.

### Registry Consistency

There is a common question that is brought up when discussing the use
of multiple registries, which vlt handles properly.

The concern is this:

Consider a package `foo` that you wish to fetch from the registry
`https://registry.foo.com/`. This package `foo` depends on a package
`bar`, also in that same registry, with the expectation that you're
fetching _all_ of your packages from that registry, and so, it does
not use any kind of prefix or specifier to indicate where it can be
found.

That is, inside of the `foo` package's `package.json` file, it
contains this:

```json
{
  "name": "foo",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "dependencies": {
    "bar": "1.x"
  }
}
```

On the public default npm registry a _different_ package by the name
of `bar` exist, which is _not_ compatible with `foo`'s usage.

So the concern is, if I do `vlt install foo:foo@1.2.3`, then it'll
fetch the `foo` package from the `foo` registry just fine. So far so
good. However, then it will attempt to resolve the dependencies of the
foo package, `bar@1.x`. Because `bar@1.x` does not _also_ have a
registry specifier, you might think that it will attempt to fetch from
the public npm registry, which would be wrong!

The vlt client handles this by defaulting every dependency to the same
registry where its dependent came from, when resolving the dependency
graph, so they are safe to use in your applications, without fear that
the dependencies will be fetched from the incorrect registry later
down the resolution process.

### Caution: Registry Aliases Are Not For Published Packages

Except for the default `npm:` alias, it is generally _not_ advised to
use registry alias specifiers in published package dependencies.

At the time of this writing, only the vlt client supports arbitrary
registry alias specifiers, and there is no broad consensus on which
aliases point to which registries, or even any clear understanding
about how such consensus might be found.

While they are perfectly safe to use within your own application, they
should _not_ be used in library code that you publish for wider
consumption by the open source community.

## Registry URL Specifiers

The vlt client supports
[`registry:` Dependency Specifiers](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/main/accepted/0035-registry-spec.md).
This means that, even without a configured alias, the registry can
always be specified explicitly by URL within any context where a
dependency is defined.

In fact, this is what registry aliases desugar to, and they have the
exact same behavior.

For example, like in the `foo:foo@1` example above, we could have also
done:

```bash
$ vlt install "foo@registry:https://foo.com#foo@1"
```

While `registry:` specifiers are quite verbose and ugly, they are also
very explicit and can only be interpreted a single way, without
requiring any special configuration.

While broad consensus on configuration would not be required in this
case, it is still not recommended to use them in published library
code, because currently only the vlt client has support for this type
of specifier.

We hope that other package managers add support for `registry:`
specifiers in the future. If they do, then it will be safe to use them
in published open source library code as well.
