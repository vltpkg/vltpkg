## Supported Query Syntax Reference

The vlt query syntax enable usage of css-selector-like strings to
filter packages.

Many of the common elements of the CSS language are available,
notably:

- `*` Universal selector, matches all selected items.
- `&` Nesting selector, allows for nesting selectors.
- `{}` Curly braces, when querying can be used to nest selectors.

Split by group of selectors below is the complete reference to
supported elements.

### Attribute selectors

Attribute selectors are used to match a value found in the
`package.json` metadata for each of the nodes being queried to a
arbitrary value you choose.

- `[attr]` Matches elements with an `attr` property in its
  `package.json`.
- `[attr=value]` Matches elements with a property `attr` whose value
  is exactly `value`.
- `[attr^=value]` Matches elements with a property `attr` whose value
  starts with `value`.
- `[attr$=value]` Matches elements with a property `attr` whose value
  ends with `value`.
- `[attr~=value]` Matches elements with a property `attr` whose value
  is a whitespace-separated list of words, one of which is exactly
  `value`.
- `[attr|=value]` Matches elements with a property `attr` whose value
  is either `value` or starts with `value-`.
- `[attr*=value]` Matches elements with a property `attr`.
- `[attr=value i]` Case-insensitive flag, setting it will cause any
  comparison to be case-insensitive.
- `[attr=value s]` Case-sensitive flag, setting it will cause
  comparisons to be case-sensitive, this is the default behavior.

### Combinators

- `>` Child combinator, matches packages that are direct dependencies
  of the previously selected nodes.
- ` ` Descendant combinator, matches all packages that are direct &
  transitive dependencies of the previously selected nodes.
- `~` Sibling combinator, matches packages that are direct
  dependencies of all dependents of the previously selected nodes.

### ID Selectors

Identifiers are a shortcut to retrieving packages by name,
unfortunately this shortcut only works for unscoped packages, with
that in mind it's advised to rely on using **Attribute selectors**
(showed above) instead.

e.g: `#foo` is the same as `[name=foo]`

### Pseudo class selectors

- `:attr(key, [attr=value])` The attribute pseudo-class allows for
  selecting packages based on nested properties of its `package.json`
  metadata. As an example, here is a query that filters only packages
  that declares an optional peer dependency named `foo`:
  `:attr(peerDependenciesMeta, foo, [optional=true])`
- `:empty` Matches packages that have no dependencies installed.
- `:has(<selector-list>)` Matches only packages that have valid
  results for the selector expression used. As an example, here is a
  query that matches all packages that have a peer dependency on
  `react`: `:has(.peer[name=react])`
- `:is(<forgiving-selector-list>)` Useful for writing large selectors
  in a more compact form, the `:is()` pseudo-class takes a selector
  list as its arguments and selects any element that can be selected
  by one of the selectors in that list. As an example, let's say I
  want to select packages named `a` & `b` that are direct dependencies
  of my project root: `:root > [name=a], :root > [name=b]` using the
  `:is()` pseudo-class, that same expression can be shortened to:
  `:root > :is([name=a], [name=b])`. Similar to the css pseudo-class
  of the same name, this selector has a forgiving behavior regarding
  its nested selector list ignoring any usage of non-existing ids,
  classes, combinators, operators and pseudo-selectors.
- `:link` Matches linked packages only.
- `:not(<selector-list>)` Negation pseudo-class, select packages that
  do not match a list of selectors.
- `:outdated(<type>)` Matches packages that are outdated, the type
  parameter is optional and can be one of the following:
  - `any` (default) a version exists that is greater than the current
    one
  - `in-range` a version exists that is greater than the current one,
    and satisfies at least one if its parent's dependencies
  - `out-of-range` a version exists that is greater than the current
    one, does not satisfy at least one of its parent's dependencies
  - `major` a version exists that is a semver major greater than the
    current one
  - `minor` a version exists that is a semver minor greater than the
    current one
  - `patch` a version exists that is a semver patch greater than the
    current one
- `:private` Matches packages that have the property `private` set on
  their `package.json` file.
- `:published(<date>)` Matches packages based on their publication
  date. The date parameter can be prefixed with a comparator (`>`,
  `<`, `>=`, `<=`). If no comparator is provided, it will match exact
  dates. Please note that the value parameter needs to be quoted if
  using a comparator. Examples:
  - `:published(2024-01-01)` - Matches packages published exactly on
    January 1st, 2024
  - `:published(">2024")` - Matches packages published after the year
    2024
  - `:published("<=2023-12-31")` - Matches packages published on or
    before December 31st, 2023
- `:semver(<value>, <function>, <custom-attribute-selector>)` Matches
  packages based on a semver value, e.g, to retrieve all packages that
  have a `version` satisfied by the semver value `^1.0.0`:
  `:semver(^1.0.0)`. It's also possible to define the type of semver
  comparison function to use by defining a second parameter, e.g:
  `:semver(^1.0.0, eq)` for an exact match, valid comparison types
  are: `eq`, `neq`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `satisfies` (default). A
  third parameter allows for specifying a different `package.json`
  property to use for the comparison, e.g:
  `:semver(^22, satisfies, :attr(engines, [node]))` for comparing the
  value of `engines.node`.
- `:path("<glob>")` Matches workspace & file packages based on their
  file path relative to the project root using glob patterns. Path
  patterns must be quoted strings. Examples:
  - `:path("*")` - Matches all workspace and file packages found
  - `:path("./packages/foo")` - Matches a specific dependency path
  - `:path("packages/**")` - Matches all packages in the packages
    directory
- `:type(registry|file|git|remote|workspace)` Matches packages based
  on their type, e.g, to retrieve all git dependencies: `:type(git)`.

### Pseudo Elements

- `:dev` Matches packages that are only used as dev dependencies in
  your current project.
- `:optional` Matches packages that are optional to your current
  project.
- `:peer` Matches peer dependencies to your current project.
- `:prod` Matches prod dependencies to your current project.
- `:project` Returns both the root node (as defined below) along with
  any workspace declared in your project.
- `:root` Returns the root node, that represents the package defined
  at the top-level `package.json` of your project folder.
- `:scope` Returns the current scope of a given selector
- `:workspace` Matches the current project workspaces (listed in your
  `vlt.json` file).

### Insights Selectors

The following pseudo-selectors rely on security data provided by
[Socket](https://socket.dev/), the usage of any of these selectors is
going to require a network call to hydrate package report data. Keep
in mind that this is going to slow down end-user query usage since the
security data needs to be fetched prior to a `Query` instantiation.

- `:abandoned` Matches packages that were published by an npm account
  that no longer exists.
- `:confused` Matches packages affected by manifest confusion. This
  could be malicious or caused by an error when publishing the
  package.
- `:cve(<id>)` Matches packages that have a CVE alert with the
  specified CVE ID. The ID parameter is required and should be a valid
  CVE identifier (e.g., `CVE-2023-1234`). This selector can be used to
  find packages affected by specific known vulnerabilities.
- `:cwe(<id>)` Matches packages that have a CWE alert with the
  specified CWE ID. The ID parameter is required and should be a valid
  CWE identifier (e.g., `CWE-79`).
- `:debug` Matches packages that use debug, reflection and dynamic
  code execution features.
- `:deprecated` Matches packages marked as deprecated. This could
  indicate that a single version should not be used, or that the
  package is no longer maintained and any new vulnerabilities will not
  be fixed.
- `:dynamic` Matches packages that uses dynamic imports.
- `:entropic` Matches packages that contains high entropic strings.
  This could be a sign of encrypted data, leaked secrets or obfuscated
  code.
- `:env` Matches packages that accesses environment variables, which
  may be a sign of credential stuffing or data theft.
- `:eval` Matches packages that use dynamic code execution (e.g.,
  eval()), which is a dangerous practice. This can prevent the code
  from running in certain environments and increases the risk that the
  code may contain exploits or malicious behavior.
- `:fs` Matches packages that accesses the file system, and could
  potentially read sensitive data.
- `:license(<type>)` Matches packages based on different potential
  license issues:
  - `:license(unlicensed)` Matches packages with no license.
  - `:license(misc)` Matches packages with fine-grained problems.
  - `:license(restricted)` Matches packages with a license that is not
    permissive.
  - `:license(ambiguous)` Matches packages with ambiguous licensing.
  - `:license(copyleft)` Matches packages with a copyleft license.
  - `:license(unknown)` Matches packages that have potential license
    data but its type could not be determined.
  - `:license(none)` Matches packages that have no license data.
  - `:license(exception)` Matches packages that have SPDX license
    exception.
- `:malware(<type>)` Matches packages that may contain malware. The
  type parameter is required and can be one of the following:
  - `critical` or `0`
  - `high` or `1`
  - `medium` or `2`
  - `low` or `3`
- `:minified` Matches packages that contain minified code. This may be
  harmless in some cases where minified code is included in packaged
  libraries.
- `:native` Matches packages that contain native code (e.g., compiled
  binaries or shared libraries). Including native code can obscure
  malicious behavior.
- `:network` Matches packages that access the network.
- `:obfuscated` Matches packages that use obfuscated files,
  intentionally packed to hide their behavior. This could be a sign of
  malware.
- `:scanned` Matches packages that have insight security metadata.
- `:score(<rate>, <kind>)` Matches packages based on their security
  score. The rate parameter is required and should be a value between
  0 and 100 (or 0 and 1). The rate parameter can be prefixed with a
  comparator (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`). If no comparator is provided, it
  will match exact scores. The kind parameter is optional and defaults
  to 'overall'. Valid kinds are: 'overall', 'license', 'maintenance',
  'quality', 'supplyChain', and 'vulnerability'. Examples:
  - `:score(80)` - Matches packages with exactly 0.8 overall score
  - `:score(">0.8")` - Matches packages with overall score greater
    than 0.8
  - `:score("<=0.5", "maintenance")` - Matches packages with
    maintenance score less than or equal to 0.5
- `:scripts` Matches packages that have scripts that are run when the
  package is installed. The majority of malware in npm is hidden in
  install scripts.
- `:severity` Matches packages based of the severity level of any
  attached CVE. The type paremeter is required and can be one of the
  following:
  - `critical` or `0`
  - `high` or `1`
  - `medium` or `2`
  - `low` or `3`
- `:shell` Matches packages that accesses the system shell. Accessing
  the system shell increases the risk of executing arbitrary code.
- `:shrinkwrap` Matches packages that contains a shrinkwrap file. This
  may allow the package to bypass normal install procedures.
- `:squat(<type>)` Matches packages with names similar to other
  popular packages and may not be the package you want. The type
  parameter is required and can be one of the following:
  - `critical` or `0`
  - `medium` or `2`
- `:suspicious` Matches packages that may have its GitHub repository
  artificially inflated with stars (from bots, crowdsourcing, etc.).
- `:tracker` Matches packages that contains telemetry which tracks how
  it is used.
- `:trivial` Matches packages that have less than 10 lines of code.
  These packages are easily copied into your own project and may not
  warrant the additional supply chain risk of an external dependency.
- `:undesirable` Matches packages that are a joke, parody, or includes
  undocumented or hidden behavior unrelated to its primary function.
- `:unknown` Matches packages that have a new npm collaborator
  publishing a version of the package for the first time. New
  collaborators are usually benign additions to a project, but do
  indicate a change to the security surface area of a package.
- `:unmaintained` Matches packages that have not been updated in more
  than 5 years and may be unmaintained.
- `:unpopular` Matches packages that are not very popular.
- `:unstable` Matches packages with unstable ownership. This indicates
  a new collaborator has begun publishing package versions. Package
  stability and security risk may be elevated.
