## Using Workspaces in a Monorepo Project with vlt

When using the `vlt` client, you can define multiple different
workspaces in a single monorepo project.

The `vlt` client supports workspaces defined by glob patterns, and you
can also define named groups to perform vlt operations on a specific
subset of your workspaces.

## Defining Workspaces

To use monorepo features, create a `vlt.json` file in the root of your
project with a `workspaces` field.

At its most explicit, the `workspaces` field can be an object with
`group` names as the keys, and either a single string or an array of
strings to identify the workspace paths in each group. The strings are
interpreted as glob patterns, so if a path has glob special characters
that should be interpreted literally, use the `\` character to escape
them.

For example:

```json
{
  "workspaces": {
    "www": "www/*"
    "utils": [
      "utils/*",
      "www/utils"
    ],
  }
}
```

It's perfectly fine for a workspace to be found in multiple groups,
like the `www/utils` workspace in the example above.

If that level of group detail isn't needed, then you can also just
point the `workspaces` field at a string or array of string glob
patterns. For example:

```json
{
  "workspaces": ["www/*", "utils/*"]
}
```

Or even:

```json
{
  "workspaces": "packages/*"
}
```

## Working with Workspaces

The simplest way to peform an option on a single workspace is to just
`cd` into that folder, and then use whatever vlt operation as you
would normally. Any installations will be added as dependencies to
that single workspace, scripts will be run in that workspace only,
etc.

If you want to work with _multiple_ workspaces at one time, there are
a few options.

### Running Commands on All Workspaces

You can use the `-r --recursive` flag to run a script across all
workspaces in the monorepo project.

For example:

```bash
$ vlt run --recursive test
```

will run the `test` script in all workspaces.

### Running Commands on Specific Workspaces By Path

To run a command on certain workspaces by their path, you can use the
`-w<path> --workspace=<path>` configuration option.

For example, to run the tests on certain workspaces by path name, you
can run this:

```bash
$ vlt --workspace=src/* --workspace=www/components run test
```

would run the `test` command on all the workspaces under `src/*`, as
well as the `www/components` workspace.

Note that glob patterns may have to be quoted so that the shell does
not expand them incorrectly.

### Running Commands on Specific Workspaces By Group

If you had configured your workspaces into named groups, then you can
reference those groups using the `-g<name> --workspace-group=<name>`
configuration option.

For example, with the `vlt.json` defined above:

```json
{
  "workspaces": {
    "www": "www/*"
    "utils": [
      "utils/*",
      "www/utils"
    ],
  }
}
```

we could do:

```bash
$ vlt -g utils run test
```

to run tests on all our `utils` workspaces.
