## Migrating to vlt from Other Package Managers

This section covers how to switch from npm, yarn, or pnpm to vlt. Each
guide walks through the concrete steps: configuration, commands,
lockfiles, workspaces, and the key differences to be aware of.

### Choose Your Migration Path

- [**From npm**](/migration/from-npm) — Migrate from npm to vlt
- [**From yarn**](/migration/from-yarn) — Migrate from yarn (v1
  classic or v2+ berry) to vlt
- [**From pnpm**](/migration/from-pnpm) — Migrate from pnpm to vlt

### What Changes

Regardless of which package manager you're coming from, the core
changes are:

1. **Configuration moves to `vlt.json`** — A single JSON file replaces
   `.npmrc`, `.yarnrc.yml`, or `.npmrc` + `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
2. **Lockfile format changes** — vlt uses `vlt-lock.json` instead of
   `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml`
3. **Install scripts don't run by default** — vlt separates
   installation from build. `vlt install` downloads packages without
   executing any lifecycle scripts. Use `vlt build` to selectively run
   scripts afterward
4. **Security is built in** — vlt integrates with
   [Socket](https://socket.dev/) for malware detection, and the query
   system lets you audit your dependency graph before any code runs

### What Stays the Same

- Your `package.json` files don't change (dependencies, scripts, etc.)
- `node_modules` structure is compatible — your code runs the same way
- Registry authentication uses tokens, just stored differently
- Workspace packages still use `workspace:` protocol references
